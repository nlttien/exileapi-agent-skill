# ExileApi Autonomous Engineering Agent System

> Inspired by the `reverse-skill` framework (AI-powered routing + On-demand toolchain + Self-evolving knowledge base)

Welcome to the **ExileApi Agent Router**. This system equips AI agents with deterministic routing, verified playbooks, game memory reverse engineering knowledge, and an evolving bug-fix registry for developing, debugging, and maintaining **ExileApi** and its plugins (`AutoExile`, `ShopAutoBuyer`, `ExchangeCollector`, etc.).

## 🎯 Core Operating Principles

1. **Deterministic Routing over Guesswork**:
   Never guess terminal commands or memory structures. Follow the **[MASTER-ROUTING.md](./MASTER-ROUTING.md)** ladder (R0–R8) to select the appropriate domain skill.

2. **PoE Memory Safety First**:
   Always validate `entity.IsValid`, check component nullability (`GetComponent<Life>()`), and use safe memory dereferences to avoid crashing ExileCore or the game process.

3. **Continuous Build Verification**:
   Every code modification must be verified using `dotnet build` on the respective `.csproj` file with `0 Error(s)`.

4. **Self-Evolving Knowledge Base**:
   After fixing a complex bug or discovering a game structure change, record the root cause and solution in **[knowledge-base/FIELD_JOURNAL.md](./knowledge-base/FIELD_JOURNAL.md)** so future sessions never repeat the issue.
