### [2026-08-31] Eater of Worlds Movement & Timing Optimization
- **Target Component**: `Plugins/Source/AutoExile/Modes/BossEncounters/EaterEncounter.cs`
- **Symptom**: Bot was instantly blinking on the 1st tick upon entering zone, and had a 2.0s wait delay upon reaching the boss arena.
- **Root Cause**:
  1. Blink cooldown was initialized to `DateTime.MinValue`, causing instant blink at spawn before player character settled.
  2. Boss phase 2 had a `2.0s` wait timer copied from Exarch, whereas Eater of Worlds emerges immediately without the long invulnerability descent of Exarch.
- **Fix Applied**:
  1. Added a 500ms walk check (`walkElapsedMs >= 500`) before triggering `Q` (Blink) upon map entry.
  2. Removed post-arrival delay completely: as soon as player reaches $\le 40\text{g}$ from Eater, it triggers 5 flasks and immediately rapid-attacks the center spawn position to hit the boss upon emergence (-0.5s early).
- **Prevention Rule**: Searing Exarch requires a 2.0s wait delay due to sky descent animation; Eater of Worlds must attack immediately without wait delay.

### [2026-08-31] SingleFilePackager Stale DLL Extraction Bug
- **Target Component**: `SingleFilePackager/Program.cs` & `SingleFilePackager_Boss/Program.cs`
- **Symptom**: After rebuilding `AutoExile.dll` and running `BUILD_BOSS_PACKAGE.ps1`, launching `AutoBoss_AllInOne.exe` did not run the newest code changes.
- **Root Cause**: Unpacker in `Program.cs` had `if (!File.Exists(destPath) || new FileInfo(destPath).Length != entry.Length)`, which skipped extracting the DLL into `%LOCALAPPDATA%\PoE_AutoBoss_Engine` if the file size remained unchanged.
- **Fix Applied**: Replaced conditional check with unconditional extraction `try { entry.ExtractToFile(destPath, true); } catch { }` so every launch forces the newest payload. Also synchronized DLL copying in build scripts to both `Plugins/Compiled/<PluginName>/` and `Plugins/Compiled/<PluginName>.dll`.
- **Prevention Rule**: Always use `overwrite = true` for self-extracting payload archives in single-file distributions.
